Description: This R package is meant to facilitate ASTRAL-III analyses and provide easy R plotting. 
	The package helps prepare analyses from a folder of gene trees, runs astral from R, and creates 
	a new S4 object type "AstralPlane" for easily analyzing the output from ASTRAL-III. The package
	provides several different types of plots, from pie charts on phylogenetic trees representing
	the quartet frequencies to plotting the gene tree frequencies as far plots.
